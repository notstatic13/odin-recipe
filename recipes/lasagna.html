    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made by layering sheets of pasta with rich, savory ingredients. The heart of a traditional lasagna is its hearty meat sauce, typically made from ground beef or pork simmered with onions, garlic, tomatoes, and Italian herbs like basil and oregano. This flavorful sauce is layered between pasta sheets along with creamy béchamel or ricotta cheese, and plenty of shredded mozzarella, creating a comforting and satisfying meal with a perfect balance of textures and flavors</p>
    <p>Baked to golden perfection, lasagna comes out of the oven bubbling and aromatic, with a slightly crispy top layer of cheese. It’s a dish that's perfect for family dinners, gatherings, or meal prepping, as it reheats well and tastes even better the next day. Though it takes some time to prepare, the layers of flavor and the joy it brings to the table make lasagna a beloved favorite in many households around the world.</p>
