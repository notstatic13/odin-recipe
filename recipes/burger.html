    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The Chicken Sandwich with Gravy is the ultimate comfort food, combining juicy, seasoned chicken with the rich, velvety smoothness of savory gravy. Whether the chicken is pan-fried for a crispy crust or grilled for a leaner version, it serves as the hearty centerpiece of this satisfying sandwich. Nestled inside a soft, toasted bun, the chicken is generously smothered with warm gravy that soaks slightly into the bread, creating a melt-in-your-mouth texture with every bite.</p>
    <p>This sandwich is both rustic and indulgent, often served with a side of mashed potatoes, coleslaw, or fries for a filling meal. The gravy adds depth and warmth, making it ideal for cozy dinners or rainy-day lunches. Optional toppings like lettuce, tomatoes, or pickles can add a touch of freshness and crunch, but the star remains the tender chicken paired with the flavorful, comforting gravy that ties it all together.</p>
