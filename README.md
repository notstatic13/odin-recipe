# odin-recipe
This project is part of The Odin Project, an open-source curriculum that teaches full-stack web development from the ground up.

Through this journey, I'm learning:

✅ HTML – writing semantic, accessible, well-structured web pages

✅ CSS – designing responsive, visually appealing layouts

✅ JavaScript – adding interactivity and dynamic features to web apps

✅ Git & GitHub – version control and collaboration best practices

✅ DOM Manipulation – connecting HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

✅ Web Accessibility & Best Practices

✅ Full-Stack Development – building real projects with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and more

✅ Problem Solving – by working through coding challenges and real-world projects

The Odin Project emphasizes learning by doing, so this recipe site is one of many small projects designed to build my skills and confidence as a developer.
